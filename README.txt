Bankist App Project:

I have created a bankist app where a registered user can log in with the registered credentials. 

We have 2 registered users right now: 

Owner 1: Jonas Schmedtmann
username: js
Pin: 1111

Owner 2: Jessica Davis
username: jd
Pin: 2222


The dashboard will only be visible after the user logs in with registered credentials. 

In the dashboard, all the transactions (withdraw and deposit) made by the user are mentioned along with the dates at which the transaction was made.

--------Transfer----------

At the transfer button, the user can transfer some amount of money to the other user. The user just has to put the username of the user to which he wants to transfer the money and the amount of money he wants to transfer.

The transferred money should be less or equal to the money the current user has in his account.

As soon as the transaction is made, the transaction will get displayed at both the user's dashboard.

---------Loan------------

The user can also apply for some amount of loan to the bank, the bank will take some time to approve the loan, and after getting the approval, the amount of loan will get displayed on the dashboard.

---------Close Account----------

The user can also close their account after putting in the correct username and pin.

---------Timer---------------

As soon as a user logs into the account, a timer of 2 minutes will get started, and if the user does not take any action on the account, after 2 mins he will get the log out of the account automatically. 

Then, the user will have to again log in to the account.

--------Sort--------------

The user can also sort the transactions in ascending order by clicking on the sort button.
